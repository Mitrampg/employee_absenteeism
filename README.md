# Employee Absenteeism Prediction and Analysis

There is the significant challenges of employee absenteeism faced by organizations. 
This project is a comprehensive attempt to predict and analyze employee absences, specifically focusing on whether an employee is likely to be absent less than or more than 3 hours.

## Dataset
This "Absenteeism at Work" dataset contains data related to employee absenteeism at work. This dataset can be used to analyze patterns of absence at work, such as the main reasons for absence, the relationship between absence and factors such as distance to work, workload, age, and others. It can also help in planning resources and management strategies in the work environment.

Here you can find more details about the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/445/absenteeism+at+work

## Objective
The core objective of this analysis is to develop a robust predictive model to estimate the probability of an employee's absenteeism duration based on various factors and conditions associated with the employees. The emphasis is on achieving high accuracy to minimize false positives and negatives, thereby enabling the organization to better manage and plan its human resources.

## Approach
The notebook encompasses a systematic approach starting from data exploration to feature selection and model testing. Various machine learning algorithms are explored and evaluated to find the best fit for predicting absenteeism. Special attention is given to the interpretability and practicality of the model in a real-world scenario.


## Conclusion
This notebook not only addresses the immediate need for an effective absenteeism predictive model but also lays down a methodical approach that can be replicated for similar issues in organizational settings. The blend of technical rigor and practical applicability makes this notebook a valuable asset for both data science practitioners and organizational decision-makers.

## Deployment Model

In this project i created a deployment model where you can try fill the characteristic of your employee to predict your employee absenteeism. This model is limited because it's just trained based on dataset in this project.
